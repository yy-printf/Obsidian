This saying highlights how great teaching focuses on building skills rather than handing out answers. I remember my middle school math teacher never solved geometry proofs for us, even when we got stuck. Instead, she’d ask questions like, *"What patterns do you notice here?"* or *"How does this angle relate to the last step?"* Slowly, we learned to break down problems ourselves. By the end of the term, even the toughest proofs felt manageable because we knew *how* to think, not just what to memorize. 


Another example: My English teacher hated rote vocabulary drills. Instead, she taught us to guess meanings from story contexts or rephrase sentences in our own words. Once, I stumbled through a confusing paragraph about climate change. She didn’t translate it but said, *"Look at the verbs—do they show action or consequences?"* Suddenly, the main idea clicked. 


These teachers didn’t just share knowledge—they gave us tools to learn independently. Like the proverb says, their methods prepared us for challenges beyond textbooks, turning confusion into curiosity. That’s what real teaching should do

## 整体思路
讲清楚内涵，列举了两个例子，前后呼应
缺点：结构不清晰，内涵不明确
To enhance clarity and coherence, it is essential to articulate the core meaning explicitly, provide two well-chosen examples that resonate with each other, and ensure a logical flow. The current shortcomings lie in the lack of a clear structure and an ambiguous expression of the underlying meaning.

This proverb encapsulates the essence of fostering independence and critical thinking in education. Rather than merely imparting knowledge, effective teaching should empower learners with problem-solving skills and self-directed learning abilities. 


A vivid example comes from my middle school math teacher. When students struggled with geometry proofs, she never directly provided answers. Instead, she guided us to analyze patterns in similar problems, identify logical connections, and practice deductive reasoning step-by-step. Gradually, we learned to approach unfamiliar questions with confidence. Similarly, in English class, our teacher prioritized teaching paraphrasing techniques over memorizing vocabulary lists. By practicing how to infer meanings from context or break down complex sentences, we developed lifelong reading strategies. 


Such methods align with the proverb’s philosophy: equipping students with "fishing skills" ensures they thrive beyond the classroom. It transforms passive recipients into active explorers, nurturing resilience and adaptability—the true goals of education.

## 结构
结构更加清晰，采取总分总结构，先解释俗语含义，再具体举例说明，最后收束总结
To make the structure clearer, adopt a total-sum-total approach: first explain the meaning of the proverb, then provide specific examples to illustrate it, and finally conclude by summarizing the statement.
